        <h2>Myth: You Can't Swim or Exercise During Your Period</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Busted: This is untrue! You can swim, play sports, or exercise during your period. There are special period products like tampons, menstrual cups, and period-proof swimwear that allow you to stay active without any leaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth: You Can't Get Pregnant on Your Period</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Busted: While it's less likely, people who have unprotected sex during their period can still get pregnant. Sperm can survive in the body for several days, and some people ovulate after their period ends. This can result in a pregnancy.</li>

        <h2>Myth: Everyone Has a Regular 28-Day Cycle</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Busted: Periods vary from person to person. They can be shorter, longer, or irregular. What's most important is understanding your own cycle and recognizing what's normal for you. If you have concerns about irregular periods, talk to a healthcare provider.</li>

        <h2>Myth: Period Blood Is Gross or Unhygienic</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Period blood is a natural bodily fluid. The only "extra" thing you need to do to stay clean is to change your products (pads/tampons) regularly and wash your hands with soap and water.</li>

        <h2>Myth: You Can't Talk About Periods in Public</h2>

<ul> 
          <li>Busted: There's nothing wrong with discussing periods openly. In fact, talking about it can break down stigmas and provide information and support to others. Periods are a common part of life and shouldn't be considered a taboo topic.</li>

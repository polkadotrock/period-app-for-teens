        <h1>What Happens When You Get Your First Period</h1>
        <p>
          If you have a uterus (also called “the womb”), something called
          "getting your period" will happen as you grow up. It's a natural part
          of growing up, but you might have questions about what to expect. It's good to be prepared.

        <h1>What Is Your Period?</h1>
        <p>
          Your period is when your body starts to release a liquid from your body. This liquid comes from the uterus and out of the vagina. This liquid is called “period blood” or "menstrual fluid". It's not like regular blood. It will be a darker red than the blood you see from a papercut. The “bleeding” phase lasts between 2 to 7 days. The typical amount of fluid released is about 3 ounces.

        <h1>When Does It Start?</h1>
        <p>
          There's no exact age when it starts. It's different for everyone. Most
          people start their periods between the ages of 8 and 18. A few people
          start before the age 10, and most people have had one period by the
          time they are 14.

        <p>
          When your period starts, you might feel some cramps or discomfort. Some people use a hot water bottle, heating pad, or medicine to help with the discomfort. Periods are not supposed to hurt really badly. Most people feel uncomfortable, but not severe pain. If your period causes you pain, it is important to talk to a doctor or nurse so they can help you.
